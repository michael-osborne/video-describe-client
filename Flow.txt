Questions:
    Do I store the QR code in the DB?

    The biggest question(s) I have:
    - Do I give the person only 1 QR code of a size specified? Or do I make/give them all?
    - If the latter, do I charge more for more codes?
    - Do I email them to the person? All of them? How should I do this?


    My question now is about the billing model.

How do I want to do this pricing model?
